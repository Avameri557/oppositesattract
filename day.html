                <h1>DAY</h1>
                <p>During the day, I really enjoy spending time outdoors!</p>
                <p>I've recently become a much more active participant of Wandersoc, since I've always enjoyed going on hikes or exploring new urban locations!</p>
                <p>I've also picked up running over the last few months with Runsoc; even though I'm still a beginner, I hope to eventually run a 10k in less than an hour (and beyond!)</p>

                <img src="images/day-img2.jpg" alt="Runsoc" class="info-img">
                <p>Finally, I also like trying new food places! I'm not a picky eater; in fact, I'm not even sure I have a favourite food because I like (almost) everything!</p>
