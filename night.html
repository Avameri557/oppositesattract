                <h1>NIGHT</h1>
                <p>At night, I like to chill a bit and relax after a long day!</p>
                <p>Although I'm a bit too busy nowadays, I've played all sorts of games in the past, including Minecraft, Terraria, Stardew Valley, Genshin Impact, Project Sekai and many more!</p>
                <img src="images/night-img1.jpg" alt="Terraria" class="info-img">
                <p>I also listen to all sorts of music. My favourite genres of music are rock and Vocaloid, but I can enjoy almost any type of music!</p>
                <p>I'm especially a fan of Eurovision, since I think their performances are pretty impressive and there is a wide range of genres!</p>
                <p>Here's a quintessentially Eurovision performance from the most recent edition if you've never heard of it before!</p>
