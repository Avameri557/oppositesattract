                <p>Here's some information about my experience so far!</p>
                <p>I'm a domestic student doing a double degree, and because of that, I've been completing COMP courses at a somewhat slow rate. So far, I have only completed COMP1511, COMP1521 and COMP2521.</p>
                <p>This means that everything you're seeing is completely self-taught within the span of a few days, so apologies in advance for any bugs!</p>
                <p>Outside of uni, I've also worked as a tutor, so I'm pretty confident about my communcation skills!</p>
                <p>I do my best to make sure the students enjoy their time and learn something new; here's some art my students made during break time!</p>
